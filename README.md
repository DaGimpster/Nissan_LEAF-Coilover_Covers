# Nissan_LEAF-Coilover_Covers
The Nissan Leaf has a bit of a design flaw, in that the cowl drains water more/less right on top of the front upper strut mounts. On stock cars, this typically results in highly rusted strut nuts and other components. Given I have nice shiney aftermarket coilovers on my car now, I wanted to quickly design something which covers the entire top of the strut mount. 

I decided using the 3 mounting studs as standoffs was the best route to take.

I laid this part out with SketchUp Make 2017, and the files are in this repo. Sorry, I'm way too lazy to learn another piece of software at my level :)
