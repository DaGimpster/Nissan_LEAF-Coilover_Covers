# Nissan_LEAF-Coilover_Covers
The Nissan Leaf has a bit of a design flaw, in that the cowl drains water right on top of the front upper strut mounts. On stock cars, this typically results in rusted strut nuts and other suspension components. Given I have nice shiney aftermarket coilovers on my car now, I wanted to quickly design something which covers the entire top of the strut mount. 

I decided using the 3 mounting studs as standoffs was the best route to take. Mine have so far not moved an inch in quite a bit of driving, but if you feel the need, use something sticky to keep the cover down on the three studs.

I laid this part out with SketchUp Make 2017, and the files are in this repo. Sorry, I'm way too lazy to learn another piece of software at my level :)
